# Arrays-and-Functions-in-C

Computer Organizations course assignment.

ex1.c

Program to calculate mean, standard deviation, and correlation given five floats.

ex2.c

The program outputs the line entered by the user in the reversed order of characters. Then, if the line is a palindrome, i.e., it reads the same forward and reverse.

Specifically, the program display, "Your input in reverse is:" (with newline), and the reversed input on the next line. And if the line were a palindrome, it prints, "Found a palindrome!" (with newline).

ex3.c

The following program computes the mean, standard deviation and correlation of two sets of data held in a 2-dimensional array: correlation.c.

ex4.c

Program to read in a series of text strings. When you get an empty line, the program returns the count of how many times each of the letters (A...Z) and (a...z) appear in the text and then exit, as illustrated below. For this assignment, ignore any characters that are not letters, such as numbers or whitespace. Also count capital and lower-case letters together; for instance, the string "Aaa" should increment the count of 'A' by 3.

ex5.c

Program modifies bubble.c to count the number of iterations of the do...while loop and display this number together with the number of swaps.

ex6.c

Program with function to compute n choose k, i.e., the value of the binomial coefficient nCk.
